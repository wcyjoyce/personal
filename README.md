# Joyce Wong

Having graduated from the LSE, I currently work at a fintech startup in Hong Kong, after spending some time within the financial industry in Hong Kong and London. I also have an interest in web development, having completed an intensive nine-week coding bootcamp with [Le Wagon (Batch #103)](http://www.lewagon.com). I like to build cool things and be a part of the most innovative trends in today's society.
